# Quick Start Ruby & Rails

This is a introduction to Ruby by using Rails to have practical examples. It requires only a base knowledge about the web, how it works and a bit familiarity with tools like a text editor and the terminal/shell. You can find a few pointers where to start, what is recommended to use and tips in the [Wiki](https://github.com/bastilian/Rails-Workshop_Todo-App/wiki). Or join the  [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/bastilian/Quick-Start-Rails-and-Ruby) and learn from and with others.
