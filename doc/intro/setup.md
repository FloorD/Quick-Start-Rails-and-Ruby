## Setup

This tutorial uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to take away the barrier of setting up the environment. If you are not yet familiar with Docker here are resources that can give you a jumpstart:

  * [Getting started with Docker - Servers for Hackers](https://serversforhackers.com/getting-started-with-docker)
  * [Docker Compose - Quick Start](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#quick-start)

In the tutorial you will see commands marked with ":whale:" to indicate that this is executed in the Docker container.

To start the Docker container run the following in this directory:

```bash
docker-compose start shell
```
