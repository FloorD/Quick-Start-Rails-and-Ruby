# Create the application

In your terminal type the following:

```shell
rails new todo-application
```
<span style="display:inline-block;float:right;margin-top:-3.5em;margin-right:.5em;position:relative;">:whale:</span>

You'll see a number of things happing. All of it is creating the basic structure of the application, makes sure that everything is there and installs what is missing. The `cd todo-application` command will bring you into the application folder. Open the folder with your editor and take a look what is in there. The part you will mostly work in is `app`.
